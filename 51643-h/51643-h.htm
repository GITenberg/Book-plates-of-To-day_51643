<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE book-plate designers of to-day are legion
because they are many. Almost every one
who can draw, and many who cannot, have
ventured into the field of book-plate designing;
and the result has been that many of the book-plates
that are current have little to commend them
to critical observers. The present increasing interest
in these little bits of the graver&rsquo;s art has
greatly encouraged the production of them, and
new ones arise daily. It is desirable, therefore, if
we are to have book-plates at all, that they shall
be as artistic as may be; and it is important, from
an art standpoint, to all those who are about to
adopt the use of these marks of ownership that
they shall have, as
they may have,
the artistic flavor about them.</p>

<p class="caption">By Wm. Edgar Fisher</p>
</div>

<p>Most of our leading designers have
hitherto been grouped in the eastern section
of our country, or at least not much
further west than Chicago. Some few
designs, it is true, have been produced in
California, but for the most part the book-plates
of note have been marked with an
eastern geographical origin.</p>

<p>In William Edgar Fisher we have a
designer who has strikingly departed from
geographical conditions of book-plate designing
heretofore prevailing, and in faraway
Fargo, North Dakota, has set up his
studio from whence have come designs that
are fresh, original and very pleasing. Mr.
Fisher loves to work in a pictorial field.
He makes a plate that tells a story, and in
his best plates there is artfully placed
something bookish that harmonizes with the
design-form selected; and, because of art
coherence and harmony in design that go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>4]</a></span>
hand in hand, his plates are more than satisfactory. The general eastern
notion in regard to North Dakota is that nothing artistic can come out of
the State, but the work done there by Mr. Fisher quickly dispels such an
idea. The plates he has drawn are acknowledged as highly meritorious by
the best American masters of book-plate designing. In all the plates from
the hand of this artist that are here grouped, and which may be regarded as
quite typical of him, there are only two that do not contain a book as a detail
somewhere in the finished plate.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 266px;">

<p>One of the exceptions is the plate of the Studio Club that gains infinitely
by the omission of a book in the plate as produced. The grouping of
the five observers (symbolic of the members of the Studio Club) around
the feminine portrait is most charming, and to the writer it appears one of
the happiest of recent productions in appropriate book-plates.</p>

<p>Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s feminine figures that he introduces into many of his
plates are likewise exceedingly effective. This is particularly the case when
to the charms of femininity he has added those of symbolism, as in the case
of the plate for Miss Winifred Knight, in which the graceful female masker
appears at the shrine of the idealized god Pan, who writes, it may be something
oracular, in her proffered album. The figure is gracefully posed and
the lines of the arms and neck are marked by pleasant curves.</p>

<p class="caption">By Wm. Edgar Fisher</p>
</div>

<p>In the plate of Maie Bruce Douglas, Mr. Fisher may have been influenced
by Hans Christian Andersen. At any rate, whether or not this is so,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"><!-- original location of illustrations --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
he has neatly and most effectively grouped the old-time jester with his cap
and bells, the pointed shoes from whence came our modern samples, and the
maiden with the quaintness of head-dress and drapery, that at least suggests
the fairy and the incidental sacred stork, making this plate with its shelf of
books and the panel of repeated heraldic shields very attractive even to
the chance observer.</p>

<p>In the plates for the Misses Mary N. Lewis, Elizabeth Langdon, Leila
H. Cole and Elizabeth Allen there are several diverse methods shown in
which convention has been pleasingly utilized. The vine and tree forms that
are motifs are very effective, and in all of these we see suggestions of treatment
similar to that which stands out perhaps a little more pronouncedly
in the plate of Miss Douglas. Costume quaintness, charm of pose, graceful
outline, the tendency toward lecturn detail and delicacy of touch, are in each
instance here seen to be characteristic of the artist.</p>

<p>The plate of John Charles Gage has in it the atmosphere of the monastery.
Two friars are busy with a folio manuscript that has been beautifully
illuminated. The one reads the lessons for the day from the book of
hours. The other has a pleasing bit of gossip that he is telling to his
brother friar as he reads, and the reader hears with eagerness with his ears
while he reads without absorption with his eyes.</p>

<p class="caption">By Wm. Edgar Fisher</p>
</div>

<p>Into the plate of Samuel H. Hudson the atmosphere of the monastery
is also introduced. The cordelier sits absorbedly reading his matins.
Through the open window of the monkish cell is seen the morning medieval
landscape whose charms exercise no influence upon the solitary recluse, solitary
save for the monkey who plays sad havoc with the vellum volume that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>7]</a></span>
lies upon the cell floor and the destruction
of which the Franciscan is too absorbed to
notice. The monkey as a foil for the ascetic
in this plate shows that Mr. Fisher has
a strong appreciation of the most delicate
humor, which here crops out most delightfully.
The border makes the plate a trifle
heavy, but this can easily be excused because
of the charm of the plate otherwise.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<img src="images/bpt013.png" width="283" height="430"
alt="Book-plate of Stanley Shepard" />
<p class="caption">By Wm. Edgar Fisher</p>
</div>

<p>The dog is given a prominent place in
the plate of Miss Lula Thomas Wear. He
dominates even the books, and it may be
that the owner prefers her dachshund to her
library, although it is evident that her books
have some place in her esteem.</p>

<p>The design on the plate of Stanley
Shepard suggests a derivation from an old
print. The caravel rides upon the waves
according to the conception of the old-time
engravers. The anchor, the sword fish of
the deep sea, and the sea-stars all suggest the ocean voyager who has
deep down in his heart a love of books.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/bpt014.png" width="305" height="496"
alt="Book-plate of Edna B. Stockhouse" />
<p class="caption">By Wm. Edgar Fisher</p>
</div>

<p>In contrast with the plate of Mr.
Shepard&rsquo;s appears that bearing the name
of Silvanus Macy, Jr. The love of hunting
stands out right boldly here, and in the
fox hunt does Mr. Macy undoubtedly
revel. He could not have such a book-plate
otherwise, and live with it every day,
let it be in all his books and have it stand
for him as it does, unless it was fairly representative
of the man&rsquo;s personality. That
is what makes a book-plate so eminently
interesting, aside from the art work put
upon it. Books appeal to all sorts and
conditions of men, as the work of Mr.
Fisher&rsquo;s here grouped clearly indicates.</p>

<p>The plate from the books of Miss
Edna B. Stockhouse is a trifle shadowy in
motif notwithstanding which there can be
no doubt the owner loves books. The
face in the book-plate reads. There is
also a love of the beautiful in ceramics indicated
as an incident in the plate. No
wonder the head wears an aureole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
The &ldquo;Bi Lauda&rdquo; plate is that of a secret society at Wellsville, N.&nbsp;Y.,
and we, therefore, forgive if we cannot forget its poverty of bookish design.</p>

<p class="caption">By Wm. Edgar Fisher</p>
</div>

<p>In the personal plate of the designer, of all those here reproduced, we
catch glimpses of the artist&rsquo;s own personality. We see him as a book-lover
and something of his inspiration is spread out before us. He goes reading
along, carrying reserve volumes in case the one
that engages his attention in the portraiture
is happily finished. Mr. Fisher has been
producing book-plates only since 1898, since
which time he has to his credit some forty
examples of work in this field. He is perhaps
happiest in his rendition of the plate
pictorial, and he has sometimes tinted his
plates most charmingly. Mr. Fisher prepared for
Cornell at Phillips Academy, Andover,
Mass. At Cornell he studied architecture for
two years, with especial attention to drawing.
He also studied, for six months, at the Art
Institute, Chicago, Ill., whither he went
from Cornell. He has been largely self-taught
in the matter of designing, but his work indicates
that his teacher was a good one. He
has privately but carefully studied the work
of the best modern pen-and-ink draughtsmen,
and from this he has formed his personal style. The methods and
craftsmanship of reproduction were the subject of special study on his part
while he was with one of the large Chicago engraving houses. Anything
that comes from his hand will be sure of the most kindly reception, so long
as his work is maintained at the present high standard.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">A BOOK-PLATE, in its simplest expression, is a
printed indication of the ownership of a book.
It may take the form of the unadorned visiting
card, or it may be embellished with heraldic and
other designs explanatory of the owner&rsquo;s name,
ancestry, tastes, or predilections. Primarily,
however, it is intended to fix ownership. How
far it satisfactorily serves its purpose, is, perhaps,
of little moment to the average book-collector;
for the book-plate has emerged from the stage
of practical utility and become a thing in itself,
so to speak. It has taken its place beside the many <i>articles de vertu</i> which
are godsends to the weary of brain and heart, inasmuch as they become the
objects of a passion so delightful in its experience, as to make us forget the
little trials and worries of life that make pessimists of us in this &ldquo;bleak
Aceldama of sorrow.&rdquo; Nay, they may even become the one sun, shining
and irradiating for us all the dark places of our wanderings, and cheer us
with the hopes for newer and finer acquisitions than we already have.</p>

<p>When, however, we come to a consideration of the <em>artistic</em> book-plate,
we enter upon a new field of enquiry entirely. It indicates that a simple
usage of a necessary and harmless convention has developed into a complex
expression&mdash;an expression not merely of the individual to whom the book
belongs, but also of the artist whose business it is to give pictorial form to
the desires and wishes and tastes of his patron.</p>

<p>From the crude, if sufficient, paste-board stuck on the end-paper, to
the heraldic display, was, surely, no very far cry. In the countries of the
Old World, where pride of ancestry touches the worthy and unworthy alike,
it was to be expected that so valuable an opportunity for flaunting the deeds
of &ldquo;derring do&rdquo; of one&rsquo;s forefathers as a sign of one&rsquo;s own distinction, such
as the book-plate offers, was certainly not to be neglected. So we find that
the coats of arms which once served as inspirations, and which once had a
genuine meaning to their owners and retainers, now do service in the more
peaceful realms of Bookland. And, assuredly, there are certain books in
a library, which are more worthily acknowledged after this ancient and martial
fashion. We cannot but believe that a Froissart from the press of
Caxton or Wynkyn de Worde, would be handled with more reverence if one
saw on the verso of its front cover a glorious display of the arcana of heraldry,
in all its magnificence of mysterious meaning. This feeling would
also be aroused in turning the leaves of, say, Philippe le Noir&rsquo;s edition of
the &ldquo;Gesta Romanorum&rdquo; (1532), or of Hayton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lytell Cronycle&rdquo; from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
the shop of Richard Pynson, or of Mandeville&rsquo;s &ldquo;Voyages and Travailles,&rdquo;
issued by T. Snodham in 1625, or of Pliny&rsquo;s &ldquo;Historia Naturalis&rdquo; from
the Venetian press of Nic. Jenson in 1472, or of Rastell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pastyme of
People,&rdquo; &ldquo;emprynted in Chepesyde at the Sygne of the Mermayd&rdquo; in 1529.
To these and their like a book-plate of heraldic story comes as a fitting and
graceful complement.</p>

<p>But the average mortal of this work-a-day world and age has not the
means wherewith to acquire such treasures of the bibliophile. Nor, perhaps,
has he the necessary pedigree with which to adorn them, if acquired;
though on this latter consideration, we suspect that the Herald&rsquo;s College in
the purlieus of Doctors&rsquo; Commons, and the more amenable, though not less
expensive Tiffany on this side of the Atlantic, would, no doubt, prove
excellent aids to a full satisfaction.</p>

<p>But we are not here dealing with the pomp and glorious circumstance
of Heraldry. In dealing with the artistic book-plate, we are considering a
matter which concerns itself not with past stories or past individuals, but
with the present tale and the particular living personage who has the laudable
and humble ambition to distinguish his copy of a book from his friend&rsquo;s copy
of the same book. A taste in books may be easily whitewashed, but a
taste in a book-plate flares its owner&rsquo;s heart right into the eyes of the
demurest damsel or the simplest swain. It may be that our collection is
but a series of Tauchnitz editions carefully garnered on a European tour, or
a handful or two of Bohn&rsquo;s Library, accumulated from our more studious
days, or a treatise on golf, chess, gardening and photography, or a history of
the state or town in which we live&mdash;it matters little what&mdash;these are the
treasures we most prize, and we wish to hold them. Now, how best shall
the collector mark them as his own?</p>

<p>He writes his name on the title-page. Ugh! What a vandal&rsquo;s act!
The man who could so disfigure a book deserves to have it taken from him,
and his name obliterated. He who could find it in his heart to write on
title-pages could surely commit a murder. We&rsquo;d much rather he turned a
leaf down to mark the place where he had left off in his reading; though to
do that is bad enough, in all conscience. Nor does he save his soul by
writing on the fly-title, or even end-paper. Moreover, this will not save
his book either. A visiting card can easily be taken out&mdash;it looks too
formal, nondescript, meaningless, common, to inspire any respect in a would-be
thief. But an artistic book-plate! Ah! that&rsquo;s another thing altogether.</p>

<p>An artistic book-plate is the expression in decorative illustration of the
proprietor&rsquo;s tastes, made by an artist who has sympathetically realized the
feeling intended. It should objectify one, and only one, salient characteristic,
either of temperament, habit, disposition, or pleasure, of its owner. If it
does less, it is not individual; if it does more, it is not satisfying.</p>

<p>Now each one of us has some characteristic trait that is not common to
us all&mdash;then let that be the aim of the artist to embody in decorative form.
And let that embodiment be simple and direct&mdash;the simpler and more direct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
it is, the more will it appear; and the more beautiful it is the more will it
soften the kleptomaniacal tendencies of the ghoulish book-hunter. For nothing
touches him so nearly to the finer impulses of nature than the contemplation
of beauty; and he would be less than human did he fail to respond. We
would even go to the length of giving as an admirable test of the book-plate
artist&rsquo;s powers, the lending of a book (whose loss would give no qualms)
containing the plate. If it come not back, there&rsquo;s something the matter
with your plate; or, you can libel your friend as a beast of low degree,
which suggests a good way of finding out your friend&rsquo;s true character. But
then, there&rsquo;s no limit to the powers of a beautiful book-plate.</p>

<p>Now there are a great many coy people who don&rsquo;t care to wear their
hearts on their sleeves; these would naturally feel indisposed to post themselves
thus before the public eye, be the book-plate never so beautiful.
To these we would say: Give us what you prize best&mdash;your home, your
wife, your sweetheart, your motto (though that&rsquo;s giving yourself away too),
your baby, anything that is truly yours. (Babies are quite <i>&agrave; propos</i>, and
should be characteristic, though it does not always follow. Some babies
have a habit of taking after quite other people.) The idea is, to embody
something individual, something special and particular.</p>

<p>If he can afford a large library, or is a collector of the works of one or
two authors, there&rsquo;s a way out of the difficulty for the coy person, by having
the book-plate represent the characteristic of the author and have his name
as an addition. That may be taking a liberty&mdash;but authors are accustomed
to that; and, besides, you are appreciating them, and that should exorcise
the spirit of an indignant &ldquo;classic&rdquo; from the four walls of your library.
Have the original of the design framed on the wall; it may save you a lot
of explanation should the spook even get &ldquo;mad.&rdquo; You can always lay the
blame on the artist. Of course, this means a book-plate for each author;
but as book-plates are not, after all, such very expensive luxuries, this consideration
need be a matter of but small moment.</p>

<p>Yet another idea is to have an artistic treatment of a representation of
your library, your &ldquo;den.&rdquo; That sounds very inviting and certainly can
hurt no one&rsquo;s feelings. If you don&rsquo;t happen to possess a special apartment,
give an apartment such as you would like to possess. Or show your
favorite chair, or nook, or greenwood tree, or running brook, or garden
plot. There are thousands of ways in which to fashion a book-plate, and an
artistic book-plate, too. We thus can see what an advance the modern
artistic book-plate is on the old style article&mdash;so formal, so characterless, so
inchoate and so amorphous.</p>

<p>Indeed the artistic book-plate is a genuine inspiration, or it may be
made so. How charming, or delight-giving, or valuable, or intoxicating it
is, depends largely on the artist. But it also depends on the individual who
desires it. It should be planned with care and executed with feeling. It
should be like no other book-plate in the sense that it possesses some <em>flavor</em>
that is private and personal. It should be as much an indication of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
owner&rsquo;s taste as is his library&mdash;and no man can hide his nature from the
friend who has had access to that. There are many things a book-plate
should not be&mdash;but these may be summed up in the advice&mdash;it should not
be a mask. You may order your books by the hundredweight from your
bookseller, but that won&rsquo;t stand you in any stead when your friend handles
them and turns to you for a criticism, or an opinion. You may also commission
your artist for a book-plate; but you are in a worse plight if you
fail in the more direct explanation you will be required to make to the
insistent inquiries as to its meaning or appositeness. No! Be it ever so
humble, let it be yours. It may be a poor thing, but it is your own; but
it may be also a very rich thing, and your own also.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>OVERS of the beautiful have been
burdened with endless talk and
writing and many quarrels on the
nude in art, and now I have the temerity
to open a new field of battle and throw
down the gauntlet for strife. The Eternal
Feminine is a prominent factor in the
picture book-plates of the day, and she
is showing some tendencies to appear
minus her apparel. Question: is it wise
and in good taste?</p>

<p>Of course, to start with, I am quite
free to admit that good taste is a movable
feast and is much influenced by the point
of view. Your taste is good if it agrees
with mine; otherwise it is bad taste or no
taste. At any rate, there are a few things
we can agree upon, I think. For instance,
that there is a wide distinction between
the nude and the naked. Also, that the
human form divine is most beautiful, but
that to remain most beautiful it must
deviate not one jot or tittle from the
divine, for any deviation is to tend to the earthy and gross, which is vulgar
and&mdash;bad taste. We can also agree, I think, that partially draped figures
can be, and often are, sensual and repulsive beyond the frankly nude, and
this without the direct intent or knowledge of the artist.</p>

<div class="poemcenter">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">&ldquo;A hair perhaps divides the false and true,</div>
<div class="i0">Yes; and a single slip were the clue&mdash;&rdquo;</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But above all things a nude figure should never carry the idea of a consciousness
of its nudity! Also, clothing or drapery used simply to hide
portions of the figure is execrable and more suggestive than any entire
absence of clothing; while to add, as I have seen done, a hat and French-heeled
shoes to a nude figure is abominable beyond condemnation.</p>

<p>But all this is of broad application and is sawing upon the same old and
frayed strings. Abstractly, a beautiful nude is as beautiful on a book-plate
as in a portfolio or in a frame, and some of the most beautiful book-plates I
have ever seen have been nudes. Nevertheless, to me the nude seems out
of place and in questionable taste on a book-plate; the simple matter of
repetition is enough to condemn it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
The partially draped figures by
R. Anning Bell are chaste and beautiful,
and one never thinks of them
other than as clothed; so they can
hardly be considered in this discussion.
Many of the book-plates by
Henry Ospovat contain partly draped
figures which are always beautifully
drawn, pure and a constant delight.
But really, I think it would jar me to
meet even an angel&mdash;the same one,
mind you&mdash;in each of a thousand
volumes. Emil Orlak, in Austria,
has made some fairly pleasing nudes,
but they lack that purity of conception
without which they are common.
Armand Rassenfosse, of Belgium,
has etched a number of dainty, faultlessly
drawn and really most beautiful
nudes, but many of them have been
ruined by the needless addition of
shoes and fancy head-dresses. Pal
de Mont, of Antwerp, has a plate by
Edmond van Oppel which he probably
thinks a work of art, but which
is surely the height of vulgarity;
while in &ldquo;Composite Book-Plates&rdquo;
is a design by Theodore Simson
containing a large figure of a nude
woman with her hair done in a pug,
seated in a grove amid dandelions
and poppies, and diligently reading a book. The figure is treated in broad
outline, which is ill adapted to the subject, and it lacks that refinement without
which nothing is beautiful. She is absolutely at variance with her
environment, and the whole is a <i>tour de force</i> quite unforgivable.</p>

<p>Miss Labouchere, in her volume on ladies&rsquo; plates, shows a rather
amusing pair of designs for Miss Nellie Heaton. These plates both bear
the legend, &ldquo;Gather ye roses while ye may.&rdquo; In the first, the designer, Mrs.
Baker, has a fair creature in all the glory of entire nudity plucking blossoms
from a rose-vine. In the other, she used the same design throughout, but
has fully clothed the figure. Evidently Miss Heaton protested.</p>

<p>These designs by a woman call to mind the fact that among the
book-plates of over one hundred and fifty women designers with which I
am familiar, I know of but one other nude. This other is by Miss Mary
Florence, and is of a large full-length angel entirely undraped.</p>

<p>Fritz Erler, a German designer
of much strength, has made a number
of symbolic book-plates. All, I believe,
have the feminine as motif, and
in several the figures are nude. The
design for Emil Gerh&auml;user is inoffensive
and well-drawn, but surely is not
beautiful, and lacks a good excuse for
existence. In a generally pleasing decorative
arrangement for Robert H.
Smith, Harold Nelson, an English
designer, shows a rather attenuated
nude maiden looking with envy at a
gorgeous peacock on the opposite
side of the design; while the peacock
in turn seems to say, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
grow some feathers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We naturally expect to find well-drawn,
if not always pleasing, nudes
in the French school. Henry Andr&eacute;,
one of the best known French designers
of book-plates, uses the nude quite
freely in his work; in some instances pleasingly, but in one or two with
marked vulgarity. Octave Uzanne has
the most pleasing nude plate that I have
ever seen. It is designed by Gu&eacute;rin,
and represents a tortoise bearing the implements
of the artist, and coaxed along by
the hot torch of knowledge in the hand
of a light-winged cupid. By Sherborn,
the great, I have seen but one nude in a
book-plate, and that a poor thing but
innocuous, for Mr. Harris Fahnestock
of New York. Mr. E.&nbsp;D. French has
made but one nude that I have seen,
that for Mr. E.&nbsp;H. Bierstadt; the design
shows a nude shepherd boy piping
to his flock. The plate Mr. French
engraved for Mr. De Vinne, from the
design by Geo. Fletcher Babb, has nude
termini for bearers, and is elegant and
beautiful, an ideal plate.</p>

<p>American artists have essayed the
nude but little in book-plate design, perhaps
through wisdom, perhaps through

fear; but the fact remains that they have thereby avoided the perpetration
of at least some crimes. Judging by the examples we have been able to cite,
and they are representative, it would seem that the best advice we can give
those tempted to use the undraped beautiful in their book-plates is&mdash;don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2><a name="chap06" id="chap06"></a>THE ARCHITECT AS A BOOK-PLATE
DESIGNER</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>MONG the book-plate designers
of the present day the architect
may, if he choose, take a high
place. He is one whose studies have
led him through the paths of artistic
training where his eye and hand have
learned to see color and form and balance
of parts, and while the usual media
of his profession are wood, stone, terra
cotta and iron, there are many by-paths
through which he must travel to appreciate
the value of his pencil lines upon
the flat.</p>

<p>No more delightful by-way than
the book-plate route will open before
him, hedged in as it is by purely artistic
shrubbery and leading constantly to
pretty and even beautiful designs in
which the genius of architecture has
played a great part. Moreover, all his preceding journey through the hard
conventional country to which architecture at first seems limited, has
equipped him thoroughly to give expression to his fancy. That the gift of
imagination is among his endowments should be taken for granted, however,
if the architect is to succeed in the line
of drawing book-plates.</p>

<p>Fancy and imagination being in his
mental equipment the architect can
&ldquo;rest&rdquo; his mind in no more delightful
fashion than by giving them full scope in
this gem-like art. His experience, his
collections of drawings, the work of
others of his craft which he has studied,
all tend to render his fund of information
large, and if he has the key to book-plate
art, inexhaustible, since nothing
comes amiss to the pen of one whose
facile fancy can grasp a good motive and
direct it to a purpose other than that
originally intended.</p>

<p>In the early days of art the architect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
was not only a designer of buildings but was also a sculptor and sometimes
a decorative painter. He was called upon by his patrons to design whatever
was needed at the moment, and these men were &ldquo;all-round&rdquo; artists, the day
of specialization and the speculator not having dawned.</p>

<p>Buonarotti is an awesome name to call up, but this great painter,
sculptor, architect and builder touched nothing that he did not adorn, and in
many of the hundreds of crayon sketches and cartoons that he left behind
him, the feeling of the book-plate artist is clear. Had Lorenzo the Magnificent
wanted a book-plate for use in his library, the great Michael Angelo
could have filled the want from his own notes, with very little of either suppression
or expansion. It may seem strange to think of this Titan of art,
the creator of the sweeping &ldquo;Last
Judgment&rdquo; turning his pencil to the
delicate lines, the imperceptible nuances
demanded by a book-plate, yet it
may be repeated, in his work may be
found a myriad of suggestions for
these gem-like products.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 360px;">
<img src="images/bpt085.png" width="360" height="468"
alt="Book-plate of Annah M. Fellowes" />
<p class="caption">By Thomas Tryon</p>
</div>

<p>Buonarotti was not, however,
first and last an architect. Painter
and sculptor also, these sides of his
artist soul would have been drawn on
for the book-plate. Therefore the
statement that not every architect can
design so fanciful and dainty a work
as a book-plate becomes a truism
patent to everybody. The architect&rsquo;s
profession calls for a two-fold nature,
the one side tending toward that of
the engineer with its eminently practical
and very necessary tables of
stress and strain, its mathematical
calculations for loads and disposition
of carrying walls, while the other side
leans to a nice discernment of color and proportion. The laying out of
vistas and the arrangement of surfaces and lines, so that the eye is aided in
receiving the best impression from all points of view. Of this turn of mind
is the one who can and does design book-plates. The very practical architect,
if he wishes the glory, which is doubtful, has one of his draftsmen make
the design and then signs the drawing and gets the glory. It would be
amusing if such an one through some luck charm received constant application
for such work. His draftsmen would change and his drawings be as dissimilar
as the men who drew them. Possibly the signature would lead the
long-suffering public to think him very versatile.</p>

<p>It is not of this class of architect that we write. It is of him who is half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
painter or sculptor, and who loves his pen and pencil and delights in the
personal expression of his ideals. He finds that his way of seeing things is
more to his liking than any way of any other man. He sees the infinite
beauty of nature and loves her shifting pictures in the clouds. Then too, he
must have the ability to clearly comprehend the half-formed ideas of him
whose plate he undertakes to draw. This is not always an easy matter.
There are but few in the world who can formulate their ideas, much less
invent a picture without first seeing it. Here the architect has, perhaps, an
advantage over the purely imaginative artist, since the average man does not
know the difference between the Classic period and the Gothic, the Napoleon
era and the modern German renaissance.</p>

<p>Of the architects who have obtained unquestioned recognition in this
exquisite art, Thomas Tryon is among those whose work is especially
prized. His adaptation of architectural forms to the confined space of the
book-plate shows the work of a man who has command of his tools and
knowledge, and despite the narrow confines of the field his work is not at all
&ldquo;cabined or cribbed.&rdquo; The illustrations accompanying this essay are taken
rather at random from among Mr. Tryon&rsquo;s designs, but they will convey to
those unfamiliar with his work, a fair idea of its scope and treatment. His
first design was a plate for his father, an ornate armorial design, the name
being set up in type at the base. The plate for Miss Annah M. Fellowes
is quite elaborate. A long-haired and bewhiskered knight stands before us in
a suit of rich armor, his right hand bearing his sword and helmet, and his left
resting upon his shield. His helmet is surmounted by a pair of spreading
wings. The design is backed by a rambling rose bush on which is hung the
motto ribbon.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank Pool is obviously a lover of the drama. In an oval window
set in masonry, is a Roman gentleman, laurel crowned, reading from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
large volume, while at the upper right and left
sides are comedy and tragedy masks from which
hang a gracefully festooned wreath. Palms,
ribbon and name plate finish the design. For
Mr. Farragut, the son of our old admiral, Mr.
Tryon has made a very &ldquo;salt water&rdquo; arrangement
of arms. The shield is surmounted by a
quaint ship and the bearers are dolphins, which
on one side encircle a trident and on the other
a sword. The conventional acanthus leaves
give body and decoration to the whole. Perhaps
one of the most distinctively beautiful of
Mr. Tryon&rsquo;s designs is the fleur-de-lis for Mr.
Marcus. In this the artist has blended most
delightfully the natural and the heraldic flower
and has produced a gem of which one never tires. For his sister and her
children Mr. Tryon has made a light and airy design, distinctively feminine
and graceful. The main feature of the design is an ornate cypher of the
letters S T. On the ribbon below the name is shown. This is changed to
the names of Mrs. Stone&rsquo;s three daughters for their individual use. The
plate reproduced here is that of one of Mrs. Stone&rsquo;s daughters. The design
for &ldquo;The Boys Club&rdquo; is surmounted by the American eagle perched upon
the globe, and the flag of our country is
draped over the tablet bearing the lettering.
This plate has been reproduced
both by photo-process and copper plate.</p>

<p>Of the three color plates reproduced
the first was made for Mr. A.&nbsp;W.
Brunner, and has for &ldquo;piece de resistence&rdquo;
a very ingenious monogram set
in an oval frame. For bearers there are
two graceful palms and the keystone is
surmounted by a pile of books and a
classic student&rsquo;s lamp. The base of the
design is relieved by a pleasing arrangement
of acanthus leaves. The plate for
Miss Cox is a seal-like design, dignified
yet dainty, and would be entirely in
place in all kinds of volumes. The
plate for Mr. Steell quite speaks for
itself and makes the sportsman feel
wildly for the trigger of his gun. The
buck and doe silhouetted against the
yellow of evening and the reflection in
the stream are a delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
Three of Mr. Tryon&rsquo;s designs have been engraved by Mr. E.&nbsp;D.
French. The famous Sovereign plates being two, and one for Mr.
Havemeyer being the third. This plate for Mr. Havemeyer is indicative of
the owner&rsquo;s collection of Washingtoniana, and is surrounded by several of the
well-known portraits of the father of his country, while at the top is a small
view of Mount Vernon. The portraits and view are interwoven with foliage
and ribbon and form a frame in which Mr. Havemeyer&rsquo;s arms are displayed.
The &ldquo;Sovereign&rdquo; plates, which were made in 1895 for the library of Mr.
M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;D. Borden&rsquo;s yacht, are of great richness, the first or &ldquo;crown&rdquo; design
being especially so. This one did not please the owner, who had a second
one made surmounted by an eagle instead of a crown. This is simpler in
treatment and not so decorative as the earlier design. These plates were
both cut on the copper by Mr. French who treated them in a very sympathetic
manner and brought out in clear relief the ideas of the designer.</p>

<p>Mr. Tryon&rsquo;s production has not been great, reckoned by the number of
plates made, but as his work is never done hurriedly or slightingly it carries
an air of finished dignity and worth that gives it lasting qualities. As he
usually has one or two plates in hand to which he adds a few lines and a few
thoughts from time to time, we may still expect pleasant surprises in this
miniature art from his workshop.</p>

coach-builder or the harness-maker furnish the proper trimmings. So
milord&rsquo;s stationer fixes up the family letter-paper <em>and</em> the family book-plate.
Somebody has to lick into some semblance of artistic unity the records of
prowess of our medieval ancestors. In the workshops of Messrs. &ldquo;Bumpus
Limited,&rdquo; Mr. William Phillips Barrett performs this more or less genial
task. He has signed some ninety to one hundred designs, which were
cut by the workmen in the Bumpus establishment. Mr. Barrett&rsquo;s designs
are not wholly without merit, but they so apparently lack the spark of
vitality and their execution is in many cases so hard and mechanical that one
is inclined more to pity than to praise. In the pages of the London
Ex Libris Journal, that industrious encourager of the ordinary and banal in
book-plate design, Mr. Barrett&rsquo;s work is exploited at length. Vol. II.,

<h3>ROBERT ANNING BELL</h3>

<p>Robert Anning Bell, Director of the Art School of the Liverpool
University, is the most prolific designer of artistic picture-plates in Great
Britain. His work has long been the envy of amateurs, and no collection
can claim to be representative without some examples of his work. His
book-plates have been reproduced and commented on in almost all published
articles on the general subject. The book-plate number of the
&ldquo;Studio,&rdquo; Simpson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of Book-plates,&rdquo; Bowdoin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rise of the Book-plate,&rdquo;
Zur Westen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ex Libris&rdquo; (Leipzig, 1901), all show examples.
His work is characterized by dignity and grace, is in good drawing, and has
an average of excellence unsurpassed. The list is complete to July 1, 1902.</p>

<p>D.&nbsp;Y. Cameron is one of the most prominent artists in the so-called
&ldquo;Glasgow School of Designers.&rdquo; His plates are nearly all etchings and are
decidedly his own in subjects and treatment. They are most excellent
productions. His work has been most fully exploited in Simpson&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Book of Book-plates,&rdquo; Vol. I., No. 4. There are eleven designs
listed in Fincham, and the &ldquo;Studio&rdquo; Book-plate number reproduces
four.</p>

<h3>THOMAS MAITLAND CLELAND</h3>

<p>Mr. Cleland is a young man who has an innate appreciation for
decorative effect and, what is more to the purpose, an ability to apply it.
For some years past his skill in typographic arrangement has added much
to the products of several of our more advanced publishers; by more
advanced I mean those with a knowledge and belief that it is good business
to offer to the public books that delight the eye as well as the mind. Mr.
Cleland has done many decorative bits by way of head-&nbsp;and tail-pieces and
initials. There are also to his credit a baker&rsquo;s dozen of book-plates. These
last are intensely decorative, and to class them as pictorial really does them
injustice. They are thoroughly conventional and quite medieval in feeling.</p>

<h3>GORDON CRAIG</h3>

<p>&ldquo;The Page&rdquo; has been so much exploited in the public press that it
seems supererogation to write anything more about it or Gordon Craig, one
the embodiment of the other. Mr. Craig is very much of an all-round
young man; brought up in the atmosphere of the theater and of books
and pictures, he has dabbled in all to some purpose. He has a clear-cut
individuality that differentiates him and his&mdash;work, I was going say, but
perhaps play would be better, for Mr. Craig is one of those inconsequential
chaps that seem to take things as they come and be chipper and happy and
youthful-hearted with all. His book-plate work is of the meat-ax variety
and inspired by the rough wood-cuts of the early engravers. His work has
the air of the poseur that is as balm to the heart of the dilettante.</p>

<h3>JULIUS DIEZ</h3>

<p>The work of Julius Diez is rich with the flavor of medievalism and
full decorative effect. The example shown in this book, the plate for Max
Ostenrieder, is a little masterpiece and an ideal book-plate. Mr. Diez has
done others much more elaborate, and with well-drawn and well thought-out
motifs, but none to excel the bit referred to.</p>

<h3>GEORGE WHARTON EDWARDS</h3>

<p>Mr. Edwards has made a large number of very excellent book-cover
designs and has decorated several volumes throughout. One of the most
beautiful of the latter is Spenser&rsquo;s Epithalamion, published by Dodd,
Mead &amp; Company. Mr. Edwards has done a few other book-plates in
addition to those listed here, but these are all he wishes to stand sponsor for.</p>

<h3>FRITZ ERLER</h3>

<p>Fritz Erler has been one of the leading contributors to that prince of
German art periodicals, &ldquo;Jugend,&rdquo; since its beginning. His book-plates are
characterized by the same imaginative spirit and weirdness that appear in all
his work. His work is often reproduced in soft tints with excellent effect.
In the third volume of &ldquo;Jugend&rdquo; there was a double page given to prints
of Mr. Erler&rsquo;s book-plates.</p>

<h3>EDWIN DAVIS FRENCH</h3>

<p>The book-plates of Edwin Davis French are the most esteemed of
those of our present American engravers. His work is decidedly the
vogue among those who can afford the best, and is much prized by collectors.
There has rarely been an article on book-plates published in the
past five years or more that has not contained a eulogy of his work, and
there have been reproductions galore, both from the original coppers and
by half-tone. There is no American designer whose work is so eagerly
sought by the collector or for which larger returns are asked in exchanges.
Mr. French usually designs the work he engraves, but in several instances
he has cut plates from the designs of others. Such instances are noted in
the list. Mr. French&rsquo;s work is characterized by daintiness of design and
great beauty of execution. He is unquestionably a master of the graver
in decorative work. In the following list those numbered 133 and below
are from Mr. Lemperly&rsquo;s well-known list, and credit is hereby rendered him
therefor. The rest of the list is made up from various sources and has
been very carefully compared and is believed to be accurate and complete,
with the few exceptions noted, to July 1, 1902.</p>

<h3>BERTRAM G. GOODHUE</h3>

<p>Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue is a Boston architect who has made
several book-plates of merit. One made for a department of Harvard
University is particularly rich in decorative effect, and a design of which
one would not grow weary. Others of Mr. Goodhue&rsquo;s designs are treated
in broad line and might have been reproduced very effectively by wood
engraving.</p>

<h3>HARRY E. GOODHUE</h3>

<p>The few book-plates designed by Harry E. Goodhue are mostly of the
&ldquo;girl and book&rdquo; type. In the plate for Jessy McClellan the young
woman appears to be sorry she &ldquo;done it,&rdquo; or else is quite discouraged at the
idea of lifting her folio romance into her lap. Mr. Goodhue&rsquo;s most pleasing
design is that for Constance Alexander, shown on page 27.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">T.&nbsp;B. HAPGOOD, Jr.</span></h3>

<p>Mr. Hapgood is a decorative designer in Boston, and his work on the
covers of various periodicals and catalogs is well known. Plate No. 5
was submitted in competition and took second prize. It has never been
reproduced. No. 1 was reproduced in &ldquo;The Red Letter,&rdquo; No. 2 in the
book-plate number of &ldquo;The Studio,&rdquo; as was also No. 4. No. 14 has not
been reproduced. No. 15 was originally made as a printer&rsquo;s mark and was
so used. It was later altered to serve as a book-plate.</p>

<h3>HAROLD E. NELSON</h3>

<p>Many of the figures in the book-plates by Harold Nelson are of the
attenuated pre-Raphaelite type, but there are others one can believe
really once lived. The frontispiece to the book-plate number of &ldquo;The
Studio&rdquo; is a beautiful decorative bit by Mr. Nelson, and makes us quite
willing to forgive him some of his more eccentric designs. The plate
referred to is enhanced in beauty by a few lines of gold judiciously used.
The musical plate on page 18 of this volume is a pleasing one.</p>

<h3>EDMUND H. NEW</h3>

<p>The book-plate designs by Mr. New are in a class by themselves. No
one else has worked quite the field occupied by this artist. Mr. New has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
used architecture for the motifs of a series of unusually pleasing plates. He
has treated in a most decorative way whole buildings as well as details, doorways,
and so forth. His plates are particularly adapted to the dignified
old houses that contain the libraries for which they were made. Mr.
New has not limited himself to this field, as he has done a number
of designs with no architectural suggestion. His work in book illustration
and decoration is of a most delightful quality, and is well known to all
lovers of black and white. A number of his book-plate designs were
reproduced and commented upon in Simpson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Book of Book-plates,&rdquo; Vol.
II., No. I. The book-plate number of &ldquo;The Studio&rdquo; also showed some
of his designs. The list is in chronological order and complete.</p>

<p>Henry Ospovat is a young Russian artist residing in London. He
has done some superb decorative work for the sonnets and poems of
Shakespeare published by John Lane. His book-plates are precious bits of
decoration worthy the adoration of all lovers of the beautiful. There have
been only a few reproductions of them. The book-plate number of &ldquo;The
Studio&rdquo; shows several and Fincham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Artists and Engravers&rdquo; lists two.</p>

<h3>ARMAND RASSENFOSSE</h3>

<p>Armand Rassenfosse is a resident of Liege, therefore, presumably, a
Belgian and a subject of the German Empire. But as stone walls do not
always a prison make, so frontiers do not always mark the nationality of art
and letters. Mr. Rassenfosse is distinctly French in his feeling and artistic
point of view. Perhaps I should rather say Parisian, for it is of the Latin
Quartier and the Beaux Arts that his work breathes. His designs are almost
entirely of nude femininity and his method of expression the etching. He
has made some eight or ten charming bits, full of life and chic&mdash;I was
going to say, frou-frou, but that would be a misnomer, for his models are
innocent of gowns or lingerie. Their spirit and beauty of execution is high,
but as book-plate designs&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s a bit like champagne for breakfast.</p>

<h3>LOUIS RHEAD</h3>

<p>The illustrator of &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Idylls of the King&rdquo;
needs no introduction to the average book-lover, and the hearts of the
poster-collectors throb at his name. Mr. Rhead is an American of English
birth and a resident of one of the suburbs of greater Gotham. His
decorative work has been long and favorably known, and his book-plates
can but add to his reputation. He has done but fifteen, and two of these
are yet to be reproduced, but some examples of his work are in most
collections.</p>

<h3>BYAM SHAW</h3>

<p>The one or two book-plate designs by Mr. Shaw that have been
published show a magnificent imaginative conception and makes the lover
of the beautiful ardently wish for &ldquo;more.&rdquo; The one for Isabella Hunter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
on page 216 of Vol. I. of the &ldquo;International Studio,&rdquo; is at the head of its
class. Mr. Shaw&rsquo;s other line-drawings and his paintings have a richness
and weirdness of design that is very attractive.</p>

<h3>JOSEPH W. SIMPSON</h3>

<p>Mr. Simpson, of Edinburgh, is a young Scotchman of infinite ambition
and generous talent. He is not only a clever designer of book-plates, but
he has a magazine to exploit his schemes and theories of art. This is
reputed to be a quarterly, but it is erratic, like its sponsor, and issues &ldquo;once
in a while.&rdquo; Mr. Simpson&rsquo;s designs are full of feeling and rich in
treatment. About twenty-five of these have seen the light and are prized
by the lovers of modernity.</p>

<h3>HANS THOMA</h3>

<p>Hans Thoma is a painter of national reputation in Germany who has
thought it not beneath his dignity to do book-plate designs. This by
way of recreation or to strengthen his line for more pretentious efforts.
His designs are along classic and dignified lines. His own personal plate
is a weird one; on it is a nude youth bearing the torch of knowledge and
riding a gruesome dragon.</p>

<h3>BERNHARD WENIG</h3>

<p>Bernhard Wenig is a comparatively newcomer in the field of book-plate
design, but he has already established for himself an enviable reputation
in Germany, and his work is meeting with a growing appreciation by
collectors in this country. Mr. Wenig&rsquo;s general manner is that of the old
engraved wood block, bold and more or less crude of line, but full of virility.
Most of his work is reproduced in black on white, but in a few instances he
has used a color or two with good effect. His choice of subjects is varied,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
